# Java CRUD App
Simple java business application with CRUD functional made for university course.

## `Note!`As it project became much visible somehow I strongly encourage to use provided code on your own risk. It is very dirty and hacky!

To run it you need to have
- Eclipse IDE (J2EE) **preferred**

  *or you need to install `JDK` on your own.*
- MySQL pre-installed
- some MySQL UI ( I used MySql Workbench )
- mysql-connector

also i used `weblaf` swing look and feel.
